            Hi! My name is Armi Angelika S. Dulay but you can call me Armi! My favorite CMSC suubject so far is CMSC 12
            because I got to take it in face-to-face setting before the pandemic. My favorite GE so far is PSY 101 because
            I'm passionate about the human naature and it is my dream program. My favorite programming language so far is Python!
            I love how easy and fun to comprehend its syntax. In terms of favorite foods, nothing beats my forever cravings for 
            Chicken Curry. My favorite makes the best curry in town and it takes all my problems away.
